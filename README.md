# 🧬 Cancer Prediction using Neural Networks

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **cancer occurrence** using diagnostic data and **Neural Network algorithms**.  
The goal is to classify patients as **cancerous** or **non-cancerous** based on clinical features.  
Key processes include **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **performance evaluation**.
